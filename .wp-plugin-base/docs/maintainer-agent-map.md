# Maintainer And Agent Map

This map is the quickest safe orientation for maintainers and AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Mission-Critical Entrypoints

- `scripts/foundation/validate.sh`: Primary foundation validation entrypoint.
- `scripts/foundation/validate-full.sh`: Full validation path that includes heavy fixture and release checks.
- `scripts/foundation/bootstrap_strict_local.sh`: Supported bootstrap path for strict-local parity from a clean clone.
- `scripts/update/sync_child_repo.sh`: Generates and synchronizes managed child-repo surfaces.
- `scripts/lib/managed_files.sh`: Defines managed ownership and publishes complete manifests through `managed_manifest_io.rb`; callers must check failures before mutation.
- `scripts/update/prepare_external_dependency_update.sh`: Shared external dependency update preparation logic used by updater automation.

## Generated Vs Owned Surfaces

Generated (do not hand-edit in child repos; edit templates/source here):

- `templates/child/.github/workflows/*`
- `templates/child/.github/dependabot.yml`
- `templates/child/.wp-plugin-base.env.example`
- `templates/child/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `templates/child/*-pack/**` when matching pack gates are enabled

Owned in this repository (authoritative source):

- `scripts/**`
- `.github/workflows/**`
- `docs/**`
- `templates/**`

## Fast Path For Coding Agents

If you need to make a change quickly and safely, use this sequence:

1. identify the contract surface first (config, workflow, release script, managed template, docs, or fixtures)
2. edit authoritative source only (never hotfix generated child output)
3. run the narrowest relevant tests first
4. finish with at least `validate.sh --mode fast-local`

For any policy/release/dependency updater change, run `validate-full.sh --mode ci` before merge.

## Change Recipes

### 1) Add or change a config key

Update all five surfaces together:

- `scripts/lib/load_config.sh`
- `scripts/ci/validate_config.sh`
- `docs/config-schema.json`
- `README.md` config section
- `templates/child/.wp-plugin-base.env.example`

Then run:

- `bash scripts/ci/validate_config_contract.sh`

### 2) Change managed release/update workflows

Keep reusable/root workflow and child template in lockstep:

- `.github/workflows/*`
- `templates/child/.github/workflows/*`

Then run:

- `bash scripts/foundation/test_workflow_parity.sh`
- `bash scripts/foundation/validate.sh --mode fast-local` (this runs foundation contract assertions with the required fixture inputs)

### 3) Change release/distribution channel behavior

Touch all relevant surfaces:

- release workflow(s)
- release script(s) in `scripts/release/`
- docs (`README.md`, `docs/release-model.md`, channel docs)
- security host policy (`scripts/ci/audit_workflows.sh`, `docs/security-model.md`) if network calls changed
- fixtures (`scripts/foundation/run_release_update_fixture_checks.sh`)

Then run:

- `bash scripts/foundation/run_release_update_fixture_checks.sh "$PWD"`

### 4) Change external dependency updater behavior

Touch all relevant surfaces:

- `.github/workflows/update-plugin-check.yml`
- `.github/workflows/update-external-dependency.yml`
- `scripts/update/prepare_external_dependency_update.sh`
- `scripts/update/external_dependency_candidate.py`
- `docs/dependency-inventory.json`
- `docs/update-model.md`

Then run:

- `bash scripts/ci/validate_dependency_inventory.sh`
- `bash scripts/foundation/test_dependency_inventory.sh`
- `bash scripts/foundation/test_external_dependency_updates.sh`
- `bash scripts/ci/audit_workflows.sh`

Keep preparation, candidate execution, and publication in separate jobs. The
publication job must use trusted helper code and verify the original artifact ID,
digest, base commit, and allowed paths before proposing an update.

## Validation Commands

- Fast local: `bash scripts/foundation/validate.sh --mode fast-local`
- Strict local: `bash scripts/foundation/validate.sh --mode strict-local`
- Full CI-equivalent path: `bash scripts/foundation/validate-full.sh --mode ci`

If strict-local fails on missing tools, bootstrap first:

- `bash scripts/foundation/bootstrap_strict_local.sh "$HOME/.local/wp-plugin-base-tools"`

## High-Risk Change Areas

- `scripts/ci/audit_workflows.sh`: Security policy gate for workflows/actions/permissions.
- `scripts/update/create_or_update_pr.sh`: Privileged branch/push/PR automation.
- `scripts/release/*`: Release publication and provenance verification.
- `scripts/lib/load_config.sh`: Canonical config-loading and defaults behavior.
- `templates/child/.github/workflows/*`: Managed runtime automation projected into child repos.

## Required Safety Checks Before Merge

1. Run foundation validation in at least `fast-local` mode.
2. When changing policy or update automation, run `validate-full.sh --mode ci`.
3. Keep `docs/config-schema.json`, `README.md` config keys, and `load_config.sh` behavior in sync.
4. Keep reusable and child workflow parity tests passing.
5. Keep docs consistent with behavior changes (especially release ordering, channel defaults, and updater scope).

## Consumer Conformance And Manual Adoption

- `scripts/lib/build_outputs.sh` and `scripts/lib/build_outputs.rb`: pre-build containment and post-build artifact
  completeness/digest contracts for application-owned generators.
- `scripts/lib/package_generation.sh` and `scripts/lib/package_generation.py`:
  package generation capture and verification shared by builders and consumers.
- `scripts/update/import_foundation_release.sh` and its Python implementation:
  complete verified manual import, using the existing trusted foundation release
  verifier without synchronization or publication side effects.
- `scripts/foundation/test_manual_foundation_import.py`: import trust boundary,
  tree completeness, permission and ordinary-failure recovery tests.
- `scripts/foundation/test_existing_application_adoption.sh` and
  `tests/fixtures/existing-application/`: application-owned TypeScript/webpack
  adoption and real build/package qualification. Its independent npm lockfile is
  inventoried and monitored by Dependabot; optional starter updates do not rewrite
  the fixture's app-owned manifests automatically.
- `docs/manual-foundation-import.md` and `docs/existing-application-adoption.md`:
  explicit trust, ownership and runtime-qualification boundaries for consumers.

Changes to local managed profiles, generated outputs, or downstream default
branches must retain the five-surface configuration contract above. Test both
`main` and an alternate child branch while keeping foundation-source signature
identities pinned independently. Compiled-entry host stubs establish integration
behavior only; actual minimum-core claims require the existing WordPress runtime
qualification suite or equivalent application-owned browser evidence.

### Automation profile ownership

- `scripts/lib/automation_ownership.rb`: records and validates exact managed hosted-file hashes; profile transitions must reject modifications before sync mutates project files.
- `scripts/update/capture_automation_ownership.sh`: captures a legacy project's current trusted template generation before replacing its vendored foundation, without synchronizing application files.
- `scripts/update/recover_automation_ownership.py`: reconstructs a pre-receipt generation from tracked Git `HEAD` templates/config with current trusted code; it never executes historical scripts.
- `scripts/lib/render_legacy_automation.php`: reconstructs published v1.8.3 raw placeholders as inert ownership comparison data. Capture accepts this candidate only with a v1.8.3 config pin, the complete reviewed hosted-template digest set, and exact existing hosted-file byte equality; normal sync retains current escaping and action-catalog rendering.
- `tests/fixtures/legacy-v183-automation.json` and `tests/fixtures/legacy-automation-templates.json`: qualify actual published v1.8.3 and v1.9 migration formats, pinned to their exact source commits.
- `scripts/foundation/test_local_conformance.py`: qualifies local/managed transitions, ownership conflicts, published-template migration, clean-checkout outputs, stale artifacts and experimental metadata.

Keep unknown application-owned workflows outside managed cleanup. Add hosted template
paths to the shared managed manifest; never infer ownership solely from a familiar
filename. `.wp-plugin-base-automation.json` is tracked managed metadata and must remain
excluded from install packages. See [local development](local-development.md) for the
explicit capture flow when historical ownership evidence is unavailable.
