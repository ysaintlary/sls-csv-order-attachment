# Troubleshooting

## Local Validation Fails Immediately

Run the shared local validation entrypoint first:

```bash
bash .wp-plugin-base/scripts/ci/validate_project.sh
```

If that fails before any repo checks run, the most common causes are:

- a missing command such as `ruby`, `jq`, `rsync`, `zip`, or `unzip`
- an invalid `.wp-plugin-base.env` value
- a missing `MAIN_PLUGIN_FILE` or `README_FILE`
- an invalid `POT_FILE` path or parent directory when POT generation is configured
- forbidden repository files such as `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `.idea/`, `.vscode/`, or transient debug logs

The validation scripts now fail fast and identify the missing tool or invalid config key directly. Unknown `.wp-plugin-base.env` keys are rejected so typos do not silently degrade behavior.

If foundation validation passes in `fast-local` mode but you want CI-like tool enforcement locally, rerun:

```bash
bash scripts/foundation/bootstrap_strict_local.sh "$PWD/.wp-plugin-base-tools"
export PATH="$PWD/.wp-plugin-base-tools:$PATH"
bash scripts/foundation/validate.sh --mode strict-local
```

`gh`, `svn`, and similar tools are still required for release, update, or deploy flows, but they are not baseline prerequisites for `validate_project.sh`.

If you are bootstrapping a blank repo, create the plugin main file and `readme.txt` before the first sync. The foundation expects those files to exist before validation can pass.

## Change Request Creation Fails

Some foundation automation flows create change requests automatically, including:

- `prepare-release`
- `prepare-foundation-release`
- `update-foundation`

Use the troubleshooting path that matches the selected automation host.

### GitHub

If GitHub-hosted workflows fail when they try to open a pull request, check the GitHub Actions repository setting named `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests`.

1. Open your repository on GitHub.
2. Go to `Settings` -> `Actions` -> `General`.
3. Under `Workflow permissions`, select `Read repository contents and packages permissions`.
4. Enable `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests`.
5. Save the change and rerun the failed workflow.

Without that setting, workflows can still run, but workflows that use the foundation's `gh pr` automation cannot open or update GitHub pull requests.

If the setting is greyed out, the repository is usually inheriting an organization-level restriction.

In that case, an organization owner must allow it first:

1. Open the organization on GitHub.
2. Go to `Settings` -> `Actions` -> `General`.
3. Allow repositories in the organization to let GitHub Actions create and approve pull requests.
4. Return to the repository settings and enable the repository-level setting if GitHub still requires it there.

If you do not have organization admin access, ask an organization owner to make that change.

If the error mentions workflow-file permissions, the automation token likely cannot push or open a PR that includes `.github/workflows/*` changes. Grant the token workflow scope or remove the workflow-file edits from that change request.

Preferred recovery path:

1. create a narrowly scoped GitHub token that can update workflow files
2. store it as the repository secret `WP_PLUGIN_BASE_PR_TOKEN`
3. rerun the failed `update-foundation` or `update-external-dependencies` workflow

The managed GitHub update workflows prefer `WP_PLUGIN_BASE_PR_TOKEN` for PR creation when it is configured and otherwise fall back to `github.token`.

### GitLab

If GitLab-hosted automation fails to open a merge request:

- confirm `GITLAB_TOKEN` or `CI_JOB_TOKEN` is available to the job
- confirm that token can push branches and create merge requests in the project
- confirm `AUTOMATION_API_BASE` points at the correct GitLab API base for the selected instance
- if you use a self-managed instance, add the Git host to `TRUSTED_GIT_HOSTS`

## Readiness Fails On Deployment Environment Protection

When `WP_ORG_DEPLOY_ENABLED=true`, CI/release readiness now enforces deployment environment protection in strict mode.

If readiness fails with reviewer-protection errors:

- on GitHub: confirm the environment named by `PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT` exists in the repository, require at least one reviewer, and ensure the readiness step has `GH_TOKEN`
- on GitLab: confirm the environment named by `PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT` exists, protect it, require reviewer approval, and rerun only with `WP_PLUGIN_BASE_GITLAB_DEPLOY_ENV_ACKNOWLEDGED=true` once that review is complete

## Install ZIP Is Missing Nested Files

If the generated ZIP drops files from `packages/` or `routes/`, check the package include and exclude settings first.

- `PACKAGE_INCLUDE` and `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE` are repo-relative paths
- absolute paths in `PACKAGE_INCLUDE`, `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE`, or `DISTIGNORE_FILE` are rejected
- `DISTIGNORE_FILE` must point to a `*.distignore` file, not another managed project file
- `packages/` and `routes/` are excluded by default
- include those directories explicitly only if they are part of the shipped plugin

If the ZIP root looks flattened, check that file entries in `PACKAGE_INCLUDE` are being preserved as repo-relative paths.

## Foundation Self-Update Cannot Open A PR

If `update-foundation` detects a newer version but fails during pull request creation, check both of these:

- `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests` is enabled for the repository
- automation on the selected host can read releases from `FOUNDATION_RELEASE_SOURCE_REFERENCE`

Both conditions are required for the automated update PR flow to work.
If the change request includes `.github/workflows/*` updates, also configure `WP_PLUGIN_BASE_PR_TOKEN` so the workflow can push those changes with a token that has workflow-write permission.
The managed `update-foundation` workflow now bootstraps release security tools (`cosign`, `syft`, companion binaries) before provenance verification. If you run `scripts/update/verify_foundation_release.sh` directly, install those tools first (for example via `scripts/release/install_release_security_tools.sh`).

## Post-Sync PHPUnit Bootstrap Regressions

If CI starts failing after `sync_child_repo.sh` with errors such as `Class not found` or missing test bootstrap support classes, check whether child-specific PHPUnit preload logic was stored in `tests/bootstrap.php`.

`tests/bootstrap.php` is managed by `wp-plugin-base` and can be overwritten on sync. Child-specific PHPUnit preloads belong in `tests/wp-plugin-base/bootstrap-child.php`, which is child-owned.

Recovery:

1. Move project-specific `require` statements and preload hooks from `tests/bootstrap.php` into `tests/wp-plugin-base/bootstrap-child.php`.
2. Rerun `bash .wp-plugin-base/scripts/update/sync_child_repo.sh`.
3. Rerun `bash .wp-plugin-base/scripts/ci/validate_project.sh`.

## Security Readiness Or Scanner Failures

For public endpoint failures, rerun the scanner directly so you can copy the exact suppression tuple:

```bash
bash .wp-plugin-base/scripts/ci/scan_wordpress_authorization_patterns.sh
```

Use the reported `kind`, `identifier`, and repo-relative `path` exactly in the configured suppressions file. Add a non-empty justification that explains why the endpoint is intentionally public and what guard makes it safe. If the endpoint mutates state or exposes private data, fix the permission callback instead of suppressing the finding.

For Semgrep failures, rerun the security pass and inspect the SARIF:

```bash
bash .wp-plugin-base/scripts/ci/run_semgrep_security.sh
```

The CI workflow uploads Semgrep SARIF to the host security surface when the scan runs there. Local failures usually mean either `semgrep` is missing or a rule found code that needs a scoped fix; do not bypass the scan for release branches.

For Plugin Check failures, validate the package and rerun the checker:

```bash
bash .wp-plugin-base/scripts/ci/build_zip.sh
bash .wp-plugin-base/scripts/ci/run_plugin_check.sh
```

Docker must be running because Plugin Check uses `@wordpress/env`. If `RELEASE_READINESS_MODE=security-sensitive`, remove narrowed Plugin Check filters and keep strict warning mode enabled; that profile intentionally fails closed when coverage is weakened.

## External Dependency Updater Workflow Fails

The foundation's external dependency updater lives at `.github/workflows/update-plugin-check.yml` (display name: `update-external-dependencies`).

If it fails:

1. confirm the failing `dependency_id` from the matrix job title
2. rerun the workflow once to rule out transient network failures
3. validate local contracts:
   - `bash scripts/ci/validate_dependency_inventory.sh`
   - `bash scripts/foundation/test_dependency_inventory.sh`
   - `bash scripts/ci/audit_workflows.sh`
4. if only one dependency handler fails, inspect `scripts/update/prepare_external_dependency_update.sh` branch logic for that `dependency_id`
5. confirm expected hosts are allowlisted if a new upstream endpoint was introduced

## Finalize Release Failed In Distribution Channels

The selected host release flow publishes the Git tag/release first, then runs downstream channel deploy steps (WordPress.org and WooCommerce.com when enabled). A channel failure can therefore happen after host-release publication; the workflow still ends failed.

Repair path:

1. on GitHub stable releases, run `release.yml` for the existing release tag
2. on GitHub prereleases, rerun the trusted prerelease tag through `publish-tag-release.yml`
3. on GitLab, rerun the tagged `release` job from the managed `.gitlab-ci.yml`
4. review WordPress.org/WooCommerce.com channel logs
5. on GitHub, run `woocommerce-status.yml` when Woo is enabled
6. rerun the same host-specific repair path until the failed channel succeeds or reports already-live state

If a tag with the release version exists on a different commit, stop and resolve the mismatch manually before retrying automated release flows.

## WooCommerce.com Channel Failures

Common WooCommerce.com-specific failures and actions:

1. `Woo:` header mismatch or missing in packaged plugin file:
   fix the plugin header to `Woo: <product_id>:<hash>` and ensure `<product_id>` matches `WOOCOMMERCE_COM_PRODUCT_ID`.
2. Credential or auth errors:
   regenerate the Woo WordPress application password and update `WOO_COM_APP_PASSWORD` in deployment-environment secrets.
3. API timeout or transport error:
   rerun release repair and, if needed, increase `WOOCOMMERCE_COM_ENDPOINT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`.
4. QIT rejection after queue acceptance:
   inspect Woo vendor/QIT diagnostics, inspect the published package. Retry transient vendor failures with the same verified artifact; package changes require a new release version.

- [Release model](release-model.md)

## Temporary WordPress validation environments

Plugin Check and POT generation create isolated WordPress environments for each run.
Their exit handlers remove the containers, volumes, networks, and temporary files with
`wp-env cleanup --force`, while preserving reusable Docker images. They do not clean up
other development environments.

If cleanup fails, the command fails and retains its configuration, environment home,
tools, and diagnostics. Run the printed recovery command from the same project directory
after restoring Docker access. Remove the retained temporary paths only after cleanup
succeeds.

For GitLab runtime mismatch, missing matrix images, or readiness runner prerequisites, see [automation host capabilities](automation-hosts.md).

## Historical Workflow Runs

Start a new manual recovery from current main when repairing an old GitHub release. Current recovery uses reviewed main-branch helpers with the original tagged payload. Do not re-run historical finalization runs: GitHub retains their old workflow definitions and concurrency settings, which cannot be retroactively changed by a source update. Old GitLab tag pipelines have the same limitation; use an accepted current pipeline/recovery procedure for tags created before this hardening. Review and restrict operator access to obsolete production workflows during rollout.
