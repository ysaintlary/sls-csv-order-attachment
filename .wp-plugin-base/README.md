# wp-plugin-base

`wp-plugin-base` is a multi-host foundation for WordPress plugin repositories.

It is the **delivery and governance layer** for plugin repos:

- managed local GitHub or GitLab automation scaffolding
- release, packaging, and optional WordPress.org deployment automation
- workflow hardening and provenance checks
- vendored scripts, templates, and documentation under `.wp-plugin-base/`

The core foundation preserves application-owned runtime architecture. Optional REST, admin UI, and updater packs provide specific primitives when enabled; existing applications can keep all three disabled and use their own public WordPress components, routes, and update mechanisms.

Managed hosted automation supports:

- GitHub downstream repo
- GitLab downstream repo

For local sync, validation, and packaging without hosted publishers or credentials, set `AUTOMATION_PROFILE=local`. See [local development](docs/local-development.md).

Host-backed runtime updates follow that same downstream host:

- `AUTOMATION_PROVIDER=github` pairs with `PLUGIN_RUNTIME_UPDATE_PROVIDER=github-release`
- `AUTOMATION_PROVIDER=gitlab` pairs with `PLUGIN_RUNTIME_UPDATE_PROVIDER=gitlab-release`
- `PLUGIN_RUNTIME_UPDATE_PROVIDER=generic-json` remains host-agnostic

The only normal cross-host case is the authoritative foundation release source: `FOUNDATION_RELEASE_SOURCE_*` may point at a different host because it describes where `wp-plugin-base` itself is officially published.

It also provides two reuse surfaces:

- managed repository files generated into your project (for example `.github/workflows/*` on GitHub or `.gitlab-ci.yml` on GitLab)
- vendored source under `.wp-plugin-base/` inside your project for scripts, templates, and documentation

The foundation is a development dependency only. The default baseline must never become a runtime dependency of the released plugin ZIP. A small, explicit opt-in runtime updater pack exists for GitHub Releases, GitLab Releases, or generic JSON metadata and is disabled by default.

The repository also enforces a tracked-file hygiene policy. Files such as `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `Desktop.ini`, editor workspace folders, and transient debug logs are treated as forbidden repository content and fail validation if present.

See [existing-application adoption](docs/existing-application-adoption.md) for a tested TypeScript/webpack integration, and [package lifecycle](docs/package-lifecycle.md) for concurrent builds, deterministic permissions, and verified consumer paths.

## Who It Is For

`wp-plugin-base` is optimized first for product teams and maintainers who need:

- repeatable release automation across plugin repositories
- a hardened Git-host automation policy by default
- a vendored, reviewable infrastructure layer instead of opaque reusable workflows
- a clear update path for shared repo automation

If you only need a minimal plugin starter and do not want shared CI/release governance, `wp scaffold plugin` or a simpler starter is a better fit.

## Feature Matrix

Default behavior is intentionally conservative. Optional channels and packs are opt-in.

| Capability | Type | Default | Enablement Surface |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selected Git-host release publication | Layer 1 core | GitHub by default | managed GitHub workflow or managed GitLab CI scaffold, depending on `AUTOMATION_PROVIDER` |
| WordPress.org deploy | distribution channel | disabled | CI variable `WP_ORG_DEPLOY_ENABLED=true` |
| WooCommerce.com deploy | distribution channel | disabled | CI variable `WOOCOMMERCE_COM_DEPLOY_ENABLED=true` + `.wp-plugin-base.env` `WOOCOMMERCE_COM_PRODUCT_ID` |
| Runtime updater pack | Layer 2 runtime pack | disabled | `.wp-plugin-base.env` `PLUGIN_RUNTIME_UPDATE_PROVIDER` + `PLUGIN_RUNTIME_UPDATE_SOURCE_URL` |
| REST operations pack | Layer 2 runtime pack | disabled | `.wp-plugin-base.env` `REST_OPERATIONS_PACK_ENABLED=true` |
| Admin UI pack | Layer 2 runtime pack | disabled | `.wp-plugin-base.env` `ADMIN_UI_PACK_ENABLED=true` |
| WooCommerce QIT workflow pack | optional workflow pack | disabled | `.wp-plugin-base.env` `WOOCOMMERCE_QIT_ENABLED=true` |
| Simulate release workflow | optional workflow pack | disabled | `.wp-plugin-base.env` `SIMULATE_RELEASE_WORKFLOW_ENABLED=true` |

## Quick Start

1. Import a complete pinned release into `.wp-plugin-base/` using the [verified manual import](docs/manual-foundation-import.md) procedure.
2. If this is a blank repo, create the plugin main file and `readme.txt` before you sync.
3. Create `.wp-plugin-base.env` from `.wp-plugin-base/templates/child/.wp-plugin-base.env.example`.
4. Fill in the required values.
5. Run `bash .wp-plugin-base/scripts/update/sync_child_repo.sh`.
6. Run `bash .wp-plugin-base/scripts/ci/validate_project.sh`.
7. Commit `.wp-plugin-base/`, `.wp-plugin-base.env`, and the generated managed files.

For the foundation repo itself, run:

```bash
bash scripts/dev/install_git_hooks.sh
bash scripts/foundation/validate.sh
bash scripts/foundation/bootstrap_strict_local.sh "$PWD/.wp-plugin-base-tools"
export PATH="$PWD/.wp-plugin-base-tools:$PATH"
bash scripts/foundation/validate.sh --mode strict-local
bash scripts/foundation/validate-full.sh
```

`scripts/dev/install_git_hooks.sh` configures `core.hooksPath=.githooks` so every `git push` executes both local workflow-equivalent validation paths before upload.

`validate.sh` defaults to `fast-local` mode, which tolerates missing foundation-only lint/security tools and reports reduced assurance explicitly. Use `bash scripts/foundation/validate.sh --mode strict-local` when you want the local run to fail if any required foundation lint/security tool is missing. `validate-full.sh` requires Docker and adds the WordPress readiness and Plugin Check fixtures on top. In CI the full suite skips rerunning the fast suite so the matrix does not pay for the same checks twice.

## Local Tooling Contract

Fast local validation depends on these commands being available:

- `bash`
- `git`
- `php`
- `node`
- `ruby`
- `python3` (Python 3.10 or newer) for package generations, recovery, and import
- `perl`
- `jq`
- `rsync`
- `zip`
- `unzip`

`rg` is optional. The workflow auditor uses it when available and falls back to `grep` otherwise.

Full local validation and optional flows need additional tools:

- `gh` for GitHub release and pull request automation
- `curl` for GitLab release publication, repair, and API-backed update flows
- `docker` for WordPress readiness validation, Plugin Check, and the full foundation validation suite
- `svn` for WordPress.org deployment
- `wp` is not required locally; release-time POT generation uses the pinned `@wordpress/env` bundle when `POT_FILE` is configured

The shared scripts now fail fast with explicit missing-tool errors instead of failing deeper into release or update flows.

Foundation-only linting and release-security smoke checks use `shellcheck`, `actionlint`, `yamllint`, `markdownlint-cli2`, `codespell`, `editorconfig-checker`, `gitleaks`, `syft`, and `cosign` when they are installed locally. Foundation CI installs and runs them strictly even if they are absent on a contributor machine.

The repository pre-push hook runs:

- `bash scripts/foundation/validate.sh --mode fast-local`
- `bash scripts/foundation/validate-full.sh --mode fast-local`

Set `WP_PLUGIN_BASE_SKIP_LOCAL_PUSH_GATE=1` only when you intentionally need to bypass the local gate.

Use `scripts/foundation/bootstrap_strict_local.sh` to install the supported strict-local toolchain into `.wp-plugin-base-tools`. The bootstrap script installs pinned binary, Python, and Node-based tools with checksum, lockfile, or hash validation.

The Python lint and security tool environments require Python 3.10 or newer. See [dependency maintenance](docs/dependency-maintenance.md) for lock regeneration, compatibility constraints, and advisory checks.

Foundation CI now installs the Node and Python lint toolchains from committed lock files and hash-pinned requirements. `tools/wordpress-env` remains a separate lockfile-backed npm tooling bundle, and shared scripts install it with `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund` from the committed `package-lock.json`.

To bootstrap strict-local foundation validation from a clean clone, use:

```bash
bash scripts/foundation/bootstrap_strict_local.sh "$PWD/.wp-plugin-base-tools"
export PATH="$PWD/.wp-plugin-base-tools:$PATH"
bash scripts/foundation/validate.sh --mode strict-local
```

For A+ release-readiness acceptance on a maintainer machine, install the strict-local tools and run the full strict suite in one step:

```bash
bash scripts/foundation/bootstrap_strict_local.sh "$PWD/.wp-plugin-base-tools" --validate-full
```

## Security Model

`wp-plugin-base` assumes a locked-down automation posture:

- workflows are local to your project and run against the checked-out repository
- every external action must be pinned to a full commit SHA
- only a small approved action allowlist is permitted
- custom project workflows stay read-only by default; privileged write flows remain managed
- release and update workflows use repo-local shell scripts where practical instead of additional third-party actions
- foundation self-updates only trust published foundation releases that pass provenance checks

GitHub is still the default automation host. GitLab is the other supported downstream host in this release. Gitea, Forgejo, and Bitbucket are not supported in this release.

See [Security model](docs/security-model.md) for the full policy and the current approved action set.

## Access Requirements

For your project to consume this foundation successfully:

- your project must commit both `.wp-plugin-base/` and `.wp-plugin-base.env` before the shared workflows can run
- if you use automated foundation self-updates, your selected automation host must be able to read releases from `FOUNDATION_RELEASE_SOURCE_REFERENCE`
- if you want release preparation or foundation updates to open change requests automatically, your selected automation host must allow that bot identity to push branches and create PRs or MRs

If those conditions are not met, the local project workflows will either fail to find `.wp-plugin-base/` or, for self-update only, fail to reach the foundation release source.

For GitHub-hosted repositories, enable pull request creation in GitHub:

1. Open your repository on GitHub.
2. Go to `Settings` -> `Actions` -> `General`.
3. Scroll to `Workflow permissions`.
4. Select `Read repository contents and packages permissions`.
5. Enable `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests`.
6. Save the changes.

If `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests` is greyed out:

1. Open the parent organization on GitHub.
2. Go to `Settings` -> `Actions` -> `General`.
3. Allow repositories in the organization to let GitHub Actions create and approve pull requests.
4. Return to the repository and enable the repository-level setting there if GitHub still requires it.

See [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) for the failure modes and the organization-level case.

For GitLab-hosted repositories, configure a project or group token with the permissions needed to push release/update branches and open merge requests. When WordPress.org deploy is enabled on GitLab, local and CI validation fail closed until you explicitly acknowledge that the protected deployment environment has been reviewed manually.

## Project Contract

Each project repository should contain:

- `.wp-plugin-base/` populated from this repo as vendored source
- `.wp-plugin-base.env` with project-specific metadata
- plugin-local code and assets
- managed automation files for the selected host

Managed files are generated from `templates/child/` by running:

```bash
bash .wp-plugin-base/scripts/update/sync_child_repo.sh
```

Validate the repo contract locally with:

```bash
bash .wp-plugin-base/scripts/ci/validate_project.sh
```

That command enforces the generated managed-file surface, not just `.github/workflows/*`. A synced repo must keep the managed root files, the configured suppressions file, and any enabled quality/security/QIT pack files present as regular files.

You can bootstrap `.wp-plugin-base/` with `git subtree` if you want that history locally, but the shared update workflow only requires a normal vendored copy.

If your plugin ships files from nested directories, keep `PACKAGE_INCLUDE`, `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE`, and `DISTIGNORE_FILE` as explicit repo-relative paths. Absolute paths are rejected. The default package excludes common development-only paths (`/docs`, `/scripts`, `/tests`, `/packages`, and `/routes`) so those workspaces stay out of the install ZIP and translation scan; include those directories explicitly only when they are part of the shipped plugin.

GitHub-managed repos receive `.github/dependabot.yml` and should keep Dependabot enabled so pinned action SHAs keep moving forward through normal review PRs. GitLab repos do not get a managed Dependabot equivalent in this release.

Managed child CI also runs a separate `gitleaks` secret-scan job by default. That job installs only the pinned scanner binary, scans the project checkout, and fails the workflow if secrets are detected.

Release publishing now emits three independent trust artifacts:

- GitHub build attestation for the released package
- CycloneDX SBOM for the packaged release contents
- Sigstore keyless bundle for the released blob

Use `bash .wp-plugin-base/scripts/release/verify_sigstore_bundle.sh <owner/repo> <artifact-path> <bundle-path> plugin` for strict consumer verification against the expected release workflows.

The foundation repository also runs an OpenSSF `scorecard` workflow on the default branch and publishes SARIF findings to GitHub code scanning.
It also includes a scheduled external dependency updater workflow at `.github/workflows/update-plugin-check.yml` (display name: `update-external-dependencies`). That workflow checks update candidates, refreshes pinned versions and hashes, and opens reviewable PRs through the same PR-governed update mechanism used by foundation updates. For `WordPress/plugin-check`, updates stay constrained to the current major series, published non-draft/non-prerelease releases, a reviewed release-author allowlist, and a 7-day stabilization window. External dependency PRs include a shared reviewer warning when first-party provenance cannot be verified automatically.

## Recommended GitHub Actions Policy

Apply this policy in GitHub under `Settings` -> `Actions` -> `General` for each project repository or, preferably, at the organization level:

1. Under `Actions permissions`, choose `Allow OWNER, and select non-OWNER, actions and reusable workflows`.
2. Allow GitHub-authored actions.
3. Allow only the specific non-GitHub actions that the current foundation version documents in [Security model](docs/security-model.md).
4. Enable `Require actions to be pinned to a full-length commit SHA`.

This foundation already generates workflows that match that policy. Keeping the GitHub setting aligned means GitHub rejects unexpected workflow drift before a compromised action can run.

## Foundation Release Contract

Foundation releases use semver tags with a `v` prefix such as `v1.0.1`.

- your project pins `FOUNDATION_VERSION` to one exact foundation release
- automated foundation update change requests only consider published releases from the configured authoritative foundation source, not arbitrary tags or branch heads
- automatic updates stay within the current major series
- major foundation upgrades are manual

## Coding Agent Conventions

If you are using an AI coding agent (or maintaining this repo as if it were one), treat these as hard invariants:

1. Config key changes:
   - update all four surfaces together: `scripts/lib/load_config.sh`, `docs/config-schema.json`, `README.md` config list, and `templates/child/.wp-plugin-base.env.example`
   - run `bash scripts/ci/validate_config_contract.sh`
2. Managed workflow changes:
   - keep reusable/root workflows and child templates in lockstep
   - run `bash scripts/foundation/test_workflow_parity.sh`
3. Distribution/update channel changes:
   - update workflow logic, docs, security model host allowlist (if network surface changed), and release/update fixtures
   - run `bash scripts/foundation/run_release_update_fixture_checks.sh "$PWD"`
4. Dependency update automation changes:
   - keep `docs/dependency-inventory.json` in sync with `.github/workflows/update-plugin-check.yml` and `scripts/update/prepare_external_dependency_update.sh`
   - run `bash scripts/ci/validate_dependency_inventory.sh` and `bash scripts/foundation/test_dependency_inventory.sh`

## Config

Required keys in `.wp-plugin-base.env`:

- `FOUNDATION_RELEASE_SOURCE_PROVIDER`
- `FOUNDATION_RELEASE_SOURCE_REFERENCE`
- `FOUNDATION_VERSION`
- `PLUGIN_NAME`
- `PLUGIN_SLUG`
- `MAIN_PLUGIN_FILE`
- `README_FILE`
- `ZIP_FILE`
- `PHP_VERSION`
- `NODE_VERSION`

New child projects default to Node.js 22. Current admin UI tooling supports Node.js 22.22.2 or newer within 22.x, Node.js 24.15.0 or newer within 24.x, and Node.js 26 or newer. Keep `NODE_VERSION=22` to select a current supported LTS patch; older 22.x patches and Node.js 25 do not satisfy the complete tooling dependency graph.

Legacy compatibility alias: `FOUNDATION_REPOSITORY` remains accepted for GitHub-hosted foundations.

Ability inputs are assigned through WordPress request parameters for every HTTP
method, including GET and HEAD; body-only parameters are not a substitute. The
abilities contract test can also load a real WordPress request class using
`WP_PLUGIN_BASE_TEST_REST_REQUEST_CLASS` for integration verification.

Use shell-safe `KEY=value` syntax. Quote values that contain spaces, for example `PLUGIN_NAME="Example Plugin"`. `ZIP_FILE` must be a simple `.zip` filename, not a path.

`.wp-plugin-base.env` is a file committed in your project repository. It is not a CI variable on GitHub or GitLab.

The canonical machine-readable config contract is tracked in [`docs/config-schema.json`](docs/config-schema.json). Foundation validation enforces parity between that schema, `load_config.sh`, this README key list, and `templates/child/.wp-plugin-base.env.example`.

`PACKAGE_INCLUDE`, `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE`, `DISTIGNORE_FILE`, and `WP_PLUGIN_BASE_SECURITY_SUPPRESSIONS_FILE` must stay repo-relative. `DISTIGNORE_FILE` must point to a `*.distignore` file. `PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT` defaults to `production` when unset.

`AUTOMATION_PROFILE=local` retains managed sync and local project/readiness checks while omitting foundation-owned hosted automation. The default `managed` profile preserves hosted workflows. Publication and automated update entrypoints reject the local profile even when credentials exist. See [local development and generated outputs](docs/local-development.md) for safe profile transitions and experimental-version validation.

`DEFAULT_BRANCH` defaults to `main` and selects downstream workflow, release, and update targets. It does not change foundation-source trust. See [branch migration and exact signature identities](docs/downstream-branches.md).

`BUILD_OUTPUTS` lists concrete generated files required after building; `BUILD_OUTPUT_MANIFEST` optionally declares a generated SHA-256 artifact inventory for a dedicated output directory, including lazy chunks. Only explicitly declared generated paths or their ancestors may be absent before building. Source inputs still must exist. See [the output contract](docs/local-development.md#generated-output-contract).

`BUILD_SCRIPT` must be a repo-relative script path. When set, `build_zip.sh` runs it from the repository root before staging files. `BUILD_SCRIPT_ARGS` is an optional comma-separated argument list passed to that script.

`PHPDOC_VERSION_REPLACEMENT_ENABLED=true` enables release-time replacement of `@since <placeholder>` and `@version <placeholder>` in tracked PHP files. Set `PHPDOC_VERSION_PLACEHOLDER` to customize the token (default `NEXT`).

`CHANGELOG_MD_SYNC_ENABLED=true` mirrors generated release notes into `CHANGELOG.md` when the file uses `## x.y.z` or `## vx.y.z` headings. Unknown heading layouts are left untouched.

`CHANGELOG_SOURCE=commits` preserves the existing commit-subject changelog generation. Set `CHANGELOG_SOURCE=change_request_titles` to generate notes from merged PR or MR titles using the selected automation host metadata. `CHANGELOG_SOURCE=prs_titles` remains accepted as a legacy alias and is normalized to `change_request_titles`.

`SIMULATE_RELEASE_WORKFLOW_ENABLED=true` includes an optional managed `simulate-release.yml` workflow for dry-run release previews.

`GLOTPRESS_TRIGGER_ENABLED=true` enables a post-release GlotPress import trigger via `GLOTPRESS_URL` and `GLOTPRESS_PROJECT_SLUG`. `GLOTPRESS_FAIL_ON_ERROR=true` makes trigger failures fail the workflow; default behavior logs a warning and continues.

`DEPLOY_NOTIFICATION_ENABLED=true` enables post-release webhook notifications. The webhook URL must come from `DEPLOY_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL` GitHub secret and failures are non-blocking by default.
Because the webhook destination is secret-sourced at runtime, workflow audit host allowlisting cannot statically validate that destination.

Set `CODEOWNERS_REVIEWERS` only if you want the generated project files to include a managed CODEOWNERS file for the selected host. Use one or more reviewer handles or teams separated by spaces, for example `CODEOWNERS_REVIEWERS="@your-org/platform @your-user"`.

`TRUSTED_GIT_HOSTS` allows explicitly trusted Git API/auth hosts for self-managed GitLab or GitHub Enterprise instances. Use hostnames only. Private-network, link-local, localhost, and `*.internal` hosts are rejected.

`FOUNDATION_RELEASE_SOURCE_SIGSTORE_ISSUER` is only needed for self-managed GitLab foundation sources. `gitlab.com` uses its standard issuer automatically; self-managed GitLab must set the issuer explicitly.

`WORDPRESS_QUALITY_PACK_ENABLED=true` enables the broader PHP quality pack during WordPress readiness validation. It is a readiness submode and therefore requires `WORDPRESS_READINESS_ENABLED=true`. Full quality-pack mode manages PHPCS/PHPStan/PHPUnit support files, and seeds a child-owned `phpstan.neon` overlay for project-specific paths, excludes, bootstrap files, and scan files.

`WORDPRESS_SECURITY_PACK_ENABLED=true` enables a narrower security-focused pack during WordPress readiness validation. It is a readiness submode and therefore requires `WORDPRESS_READINESS_ENABLED=true`. That pack runs explicit `WordPress.Security`, `WordPress.DB`, and `WordPress.WP.Capabilities` sniffs, blocks risky public endpoint patterns, and audits root Composer/npm runtime dependencies when lock files are present.

`GITHUB_CODE_SCANNING_UPLOAD_ENABLED` defaults to `true`. Set it to `false` when GitHub code-scanning ingestion is unavailable. This controls only dashboard upload: Semgrep execution, failure enforcement, and the downloadable SARIF artifact remain enabled.

`RELEASE_READINESS_MODE=security-sensitive` is an opt-in fail-closed release profile for plugins with elevated security requirements. It requires `WORDPRESS_READINESS_ENABLED=true`, `WORDPRESS_QUALITY_PACK_ENABLED=true`, `WORDPRESS_SECURITY_PACK_ENABLED=true`, strict Plugin Check warnings, full Plugin Check coverage without check/category/ignore/severity filters, and the default high admin UI npm audit threshold.

Use `.wp-plugin-base-security-suppressions.json` (or set `WP_PLUGIN_BASE_SECURITY_SUPPRESSIONS_FILE`) to declare intentional public endpoint exceptions with mandatory justification.

If `POT_FILE` is configured, release preparation generates it when it is missing. The path still needs to stay inside the repository and point at a writable location. Translation support also requires a `Domain Path` plugin header, typically `/languages/`, when `POT_FILE` is configured or a `languages/` directory is present.

Workflow files use the `.yml` extension. `.yaml` workflow files are rejected by project and foundation validation.

`WP_PLUGIN_BASE_PLUGIN_CHECK_*` keys provide optional policy controls for Plugin Check execution during WordPress readiness validation:

- `..._CHECKS` runs only specific checks.
- `..._EXCLUDE_CHECKS` excludes specific checks.
- `..._CATEGORIES` filters checks by categories such as `plugin_repo,security`.
- `..._IGNORE_CODES` ignores specific Plugin Check result codes.
- `..._STRICT_WARNINGS=true` fails readiness validation on warnings in addition to errors.
- `..._SEVERITY`, `..._ERROR_SEVERITY`, and `..._WARNING_SEVERITY` pass through severity thresholds to Plugin Check.

Plugin Check reports preserve file paths, line/column positions, result codes, error/warning types, messages and documentation links in `dist/plugin-check.json`. Failure summaries include the finding's file and line when supplied by the checker.

`ADMIN_UI_NPM_AUDIT_LEVEL` controls the managed admin UI npm audit threshold when the security pack is enabled. Keep the default `high` for release readiness. `critical` is only allowed outside `RELEASE_READINESS_MODE=security-sensitive` as a temporary compatibility override for non-runtime, upstream-owned admin UI toolchain advisories while you update `@wordpress/*` packages or add narrow npm `overrides`.

`PHP_RUNTIME_MATRIX` enables an additional CI smoke job across the listed interpreter versions, for example `PHP_RUNTIME_MATRIX=8.3,8.4,8.5`. The matrix reruns repository validation, WordPress metadata checks, and a direct main-plugin load smoke with each configured PHP version. Set `PHP_RUNTIME_MATRIX_MODE=strict` to also run PHPUnit in the matrix when `phpunit.xml.dist` and the managed quality-pack tool bundle are present.

`PHPSTAN_MEMORY_LIMIT` optionally passes a memory limit to the managed PHPStan command, for example `768M`, `1G`, or `-1`. Keep analysis paths, excludes, bootstrap files, and scan files in the child-owned `phpstan.neon` overlay so sync can update `phpstan.neon.dist` without taking over project-specific analysis scope.

PHP quality-pack and runtime-matrix behavior matrix:

| `WORDPRESS_QUALITY_PACK_ENABLED` | `PHP_RUNTIME_MATRIX` | `PHP_RUNTIME_MATRIX_MODE` | Managed PHPUnit bridge files (`phpunit.xml.dist`, `tests/bootstrap.php`, `.wp-plugin-base-quality-pack/**`, `tests/wp-plugin-base/*Test.php`) | Full pack-only files (`.phpcs.xml.dist`, `phpstan.neon.dist`) and seeded child-owned files (`phpstan.neon`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `false` | unset | `smoke` (default) | no | no |
| `false` | set | `smoke` | no | no |
| `false` | set | `strict` | yes | no |
| `true` | unset or set | `smoke` or `strict` | yes | yes |

Strict runtime matrix mode can therefore manage and execute the PHPUnit bridge even when the full quality pack is disabled. This is expected behavior, not a framework gap.

When the PHPUnit bridge is active, treat `tests/bootstrap.php` as managed and keep child-specific preload/support-class wiring in `tests/wp-plugin-base/bootstrap-child.php`. The managed `phpunit.xml.dist` discovers `*Test.php` files under `tests/`, so project tests can live in a child-owned path such as `tests/php`. During migration, move custom preloads there before or immediately after sync to avoid post-sync CI regressions.

`WOOCOMMERCE_QIT_ENABLED=true` syncs an optional manual WooCommerce QIT workflow into a GitHub child repository. GitLab rejects this toggle; use project-owned GitLab QIT automation. That workflow is intended for WooCommerce Marketplace/partner use, expects `QIT_USER` and `QIT_APP_PASSWORD` secrets plus a manually provided WooCommerce extension slug, and uses a pinned internal `woocommerce/qit-cli` version.

`WOOCOMMERCE_COM_PRODUCT_ID` enables WooCommerce.com Marketplace release deploy preflight and upload when the CI variable `WOOCOMMERCE_COM_DEPLOY_ENABLED=true` is set. Keep `WOO_COM_USERNAME` and `WOO_COM_APP_PASSWORD` in protected CI secrets. Leave the product ID empty during Woo onboarding approval and the release flow soft-skips Woo deploy.

`WOOCOMMERCE_COM_ENDPOINT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` controls WooCommerce.com API request timeouts for deploy and status checks (default `30` seconds).

`PLUGIN_RUNTIME_UPDATE_PROVIDER=github-release|gitlab-release|generic-json` enables an opt-in runtime pack that ships YahnisElsts Plugin Update Checker in `lib/wp-plugin-base/plugin-update-checker/` and a managed bootstrap in `lib/wp-plugin-base/wp-plugin-base-runtime-updater.php`. Set `PLUGIN_RUNTIME_UPDATE_SOURCE_URL` to the matching repository or JSON metadata URL and add `require_once __DIR__ . '/lib/wp-plugin-base/wp-plugin-base-runtime-updater.php';` to the plugin main file. `github-release` requires `AUTOMATION_PROVIDER=github`. `gitlab-release` requires `AUTOMATION_PROVIDER=gitlab`. `generic-json` is host-agnostic, but it is a runtime updater transport only, not a supported `FOUNDATION_RELEASE_SOURCE_PROVIDER` or native source contract for managed downstream automation. Systems such as `wp-core-base` should keep consuming the authoritative Git host release surface. Runtime update URLs must be public HTTPS URLs without credentials, query strings, fragments, localhost/private-network hosts, or token-like material. `GITHUB_RELEASE_UPDATER_ENABLED` and `GITHUB_RELEASE_UPDATER_REPO_URL` remain accepted as GitHub-only compatibility aliases.

`RUNTIME_CLASS_PREFIX` remains empty for existing runtime consumers for backward compatibility. On the first sync of a new REST/admin runtime, sync writes a deterministic slug-based prefix to the project config. An explicit empty `RUNTIME_CLASS_PREFIX=` preserves legacy names. Set a unique prefix such as `Example_Plugin_` before generating REST/admin packs to isolate their PHP classes and seed callbacks from other plugins. This creates identifiers such as `Example_Plugin_WP_Plugin_Base_Admin_UI_Loader` and `example_plugin_wp_plugin_base_example_rest_operation_get_settings`. The prefix must start with a letter, end with an underscore, and contain only letters, digits, and underscores (at most 64 characters). PHP identifiers are case-insensitive: prefixes differing only in case are not distinct. This setting does not change hooks, error codes, filenames, REST namespaces, or upstream update-library identifiers.

Changing the prefix in an existing project requires updating project-owned bootstrap/class references and seeded callback functions manually; synchronization preserves existing child-owned files. Choose a stable prefix before first enabling the packs. Each plugin installed together must use a different nonempty prefix, apart from at most one legacy unprefixed consumer. Managed pack files must be regenerated from the foundation, never patched directly.

`REST_OPERATIONS_PACK_ENABLED=true` enables an opt-in runtime pack that manages a shared REST operation registry and adapters in `lib/wp-plugin-base/rest-operations/` while seeding child-owned examples in `includes/rest-operations/`. Set `REST_API_NAMESPACE=<plugin-slug>/v1` to override the default namespace and add `require_once __DIR__ . '/lib/wp-plugin-base/rest-operations/bootstrap.php';` to the plugin main file.

`REST_ABILITIES_ENABLED=true` enables the managed Abilities adapter for the REST operations pack when the target WordPress runtime exposes the Abilities API.

Disabling `REST_OPERATIONS_PACK_ENABLED` is also a manual reconciliation step. Sync removes the managed bootstrap, but you must remove the child-owned `require_once __DIR__ . '/lib/wp-plugin-base/rest-operations/bootstrap.php';` include before validation or packaging will pass.

`ADMIN_UI_PACK_ENABLED=true` enables an opt-in runtime pack that manages a shared admin UI bootstrap in `lib/wp-plugin-base/admin-ui/`, seeds child-owned app sources in `.wp-plugin-base-admin-ui/`, and expects `BUILD_SCRIPT=.wp-plugin-base-admin-ui/build.sh`. Add `require_once __DIR__ . '/lib/wp-plugin-base/admin-ui/bootstrap.php';` to the plugin main file. The admin UI pack also requires `REST_OPERATIONS_PACK_ENABLED=true`.

`ADMIN_UI_STARTER=basic|dataviews` selects which admin starter is seeded when the admin UI pack is enabled. `basic` is the default lighter component-only starter. `dataviews` seeds the DataForm/DataViews starter.

`ADMIN_UI_EXPERIMENTAL_DATAVIEWS=true` remains supported as a backward-compatible alias for `ADMIN_UI_STARTER=dataviews`.

The admin starter files are child-owned and seeded once. Changing `ADMIN_UI_STARTER` after the first sync does not rewrite those files; `validate_project.sh` will fail until the child-owned starter is reconciled manually or re-seeded intentionally.

Disabling `ADMIN_UI_PACK_ENABLED` is also a manual reconciliation step. Sync removes the managed bootstrap, but you must remove the child-owned `require_once __DIR__ . '/lib/wp-plugin-base/admin-ui/bootstrap.php';` include, clear `BUILD_SCRIPT=.wp-plugin-base-admin-ui/build.sh`, and delete any stale `assets/admin-ui/` build outputs before validation or packaging will pass. Deleting the seeded `.wp-plugin-base-admin-ui/` sources is optional but recommended once the pack is intentionally removed.

`EXTRA_ALLOWED_HOSTS` allows additional outbound URL hosts for workflow/script audit policy (comma-separated hostnames only). Localhost, private-network, link-local, single-label, and `*.internal` hosts are rejected; keep this list minimal.

Local `validate.sh` defaults to `fast-local` mode. That mode proves the release tooling wiring and reports any checks that were skipped when local prerequisites are unavailable. Use `--mode strict-local` after `bootstrap_strict_local.sh` for CI-like tool enforcement on a contributor machine. GitHub `foundation-ci` runs `validate.sh --mode ci` and is the authoritative strict execution path for GitHub Actions OIDC-sensitive Sigstore signing checks.

## WordPress.org Deploy

WordPress.org deploy is built into the shared release workflow and is disabled by default.

To enable it in your project:

1. set `WP_ORG_DEPLOY_ENABLED=true` in the selected CI host
2. set `WORDPRESS_ORG_SLUG` in `.wp-plugin-base.env`
3. provide `SVN_USERNAME` and `SVN_PASSWORD` as protected CI secrets on that host

If `WP_ORG_DEPLOY_ENABLED` is unset or any value other than `true`, the release workflow skips SVN deploy.

Release publication uses host-release-first ordering: the selected Git host release publishes first, then enabled distribution channels (WordPress.org and WooCommerce.com) run post-publish.

WordPress.org can therefore fail after the selected Git host release is already public.

Repair runbook after publication:

- GitHub stable release: run the manual `release.yml` workflow for the existing tag, then run `woocommerce-status.yml` when WooCommerce.com is enabled
- GitHub prerelease: push or rerun the trusted prerelease tag so `publish-tag-release.yml` creates or repairs the prerelease GitHub Release
- GitLab: rerun the tagged `release` job from the managed `.gitlab-ci.yml`; there is no separate `woocommerce-status.yml` workflow on GitLab, so inspect Woo vendor/QIT status directly when that channel is enabled

If you are migrating from older internal release ordering where WordPress.org deploy blocked tag publication, treat this as a behavior change and update release runbooks.

For stronger review on production publishing, protect the deployment environment named by `PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT` and require at least one reviewer before the workflow can access deploy credentials. GitHub validation checks this automatically. GitLab validation fails closed until you rerun with `WP_PLUGIN_BASE_GITLAB_DEPLOY_ENV_ACKNOWLEDGED=true` after manually reviewing the protected environment rules.

Repair flows skip WordPress.org redeploy by default so an existing `tags/<version>` entry is not mutated during a repair run. On GitHub that behavior lives in the manual `release.yml` workflow for stable tags and the prerelease-only `publish-tag-release.yml` workflow for trusted prerelease tags. On GitLab it lives in the tagged `release` job from the managed `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Only set the repository or environment variable `WP_PLUGIN_BASE_ALLOW_WPORG_TAG_REDEPLOY=true` for an intentional break-glass redeploy of the latest repository release tag.

Dependency updates in GitHub children default to `DEPENDABOT_ECOSYSTEMS=auto`: GitHub Actions plus root Composer/npm manifests and enabled or existing admin UI npm sources. Set an explicit comma-separated list of `github-actions`, `composer`, `npm`, and `admin-ui-npm` to select coverage. Seed manifests remain project-owned; review and merge dependency updates in each child. Foundation upgrades do not silently overwrite custom application dependencies. See [existing project migration](docs/existing-project-migration.md) before upgrading a seeded admin UI.

See [engineering quality and Woo comparison](docs/engineering-quality.md) for merge gates and evaluation criteria, and [automation host capabilities](docs/automation-hosts.md) for GitLab acceptance requirements.

The experimental DataViews starter requires WordPress 7.1 or newer. Both the plugin header and readme must declare `Requires at least: 7.1` (or newer); artifact validation rejects incompatible or missing metadata. The basic starter and REST/Abilities boundary retain their separate compatibility coverage.
